## Environment

“Close your tabs, girl!!” This is the motto of this week. It’s also this week’s revelation. 

My work space is pretty good at this point. It’s been through many iterations until now. I am lucky to be able to work from my house, in my basement. It’s cold, a little musty, but it has big windows and lots of space. I have over time gathered great supportive props to have a comfortable coding environment. I have a nice chair that wheels around, I have a convertible monitor & keyboard stand, I have a second large monitor, bluetooth noise canceling headphones (a mom’s best friend!) and a desktop space heater. I am surrounded by kids' art supplies, a lego table, an indoor basketball hoop and my kids have a pretty awesome indoor soccer set-up that goes on behind me while I work. Noise canceling headphones…remember?

My desk space is pretty well organized and I’ve figured out many creature comforts to optimize my performance as a developer. But…..don’t look at my monitor! Are those 156 browser tabs open all at the same time?!?!? How? Why!?! That is the entirety of chaos theory shoved onto one relatively big monitor screen. This outward façade of organized togetherness can’t overshadow this digital pigsty. 

For some reason, I’ve developed a fear of closing browser tabs. Maybe I think I’ll never be able to find them again or maybe I think I’ll need them even when I most likely won’t. My army of open browser tabs that so diligently stand the line at the top of the screen like faithful little soldiers are probably quietly whispering to each other how crazy I am. They are the perfect visual representation of how my mind feels in this current time and space as I’m anxiously trying to learn as much as I can, as fast as I can, while desperately trying to hold onto this information and defeat digital amnesia. With my steadfast and obedient team of tab soldiers behind me, we can do this! We’re going to know everything all at once and never forget it! 

Obviously, this isn’t true. 😔Not only is this not true, but I think it may be making me less productive. It is like the digital manifestation of the overwhelm in my brain and literally having it at the top of the rectangle I look at all day is an ever-present reminder of this. Taking the brave step to evaluate the tabs and dare-I-say….c-c-c-lose one? Oh I’m getting the shivers as I type and think about sending one of my tab soldiers back to the cyber waves at large. I have been so crazy about this tab editing, that I even went through the trouble of downloading and learning how to use a tab manager. She’s pretty cool, her name’s Workona, she keeps the troops in line. I have no complaints about her really, other than maybe she’s a crutch that supports my psychosis? 

In any case, I have learned that my developer environment is not just about where my body exists. It’s very much about where my mind is interacting with, where my cold but dexterous fingers and focused but tired eyes interface with…my digital environment. Don’t even get me started about my VS Code! The first step to overcoming any problem is admitting you have a problem. I’m coming to terms with my outsized army of browser tabs. I have learned that closing them, or managing them (which is Nicorette for chronic tab abusers), is a BIG and IMPORTANT step towards me being able to focus on one task at a time until it is complete. Although this seems like it may be less productive, it is in fact an amazing secret to productivity. Unfortunately, I do not have a multi-core processor like my amazing co-worker, the MacBook. It is still more efficient for me to give my focus to one task at a time. As much as I look up to this brilliant co-worker, we will never be the same. I think the sooner I accept that, the sooner I will be able to truly defeat that digital amnesia. That’s it, that’s the revelation. For all of you fellow tab abusers out there–no judgment! I’ll see you at the next meeting 😉
